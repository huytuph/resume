# about me 
aboutme = """
I have been in the automotive industry for over a decade.
During my time at Redbook Inspect(owned by carsales.com), I was given an opportunity to be involved in a mentorship program with a SecDevOps Engineer. 
During this mentorship program I had discovered a strong passion for cloud computing, automation, security, networking & programming.

I actively engage in a lot of DIY projects in my spare time as a hobby.
I enjoy making tools forwork to help automate processes & help assist in team collaboration.

I am passionate, self driven & self taught. I take pride in my work & I'm always constantly looking for ways to improve.
